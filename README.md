Directions: This Appointment Scheduler is able to manage appointments and customers effortlessly for any organization.
The application determines the location of the user's office and will subsequently offer the scheduler in French or in
English. After providing a valid username and password at the login screen, the user is taken to the Appointments Main page. As
can be seen, there are 'add', 'modify', and 'delete' buttons for both appointments and customers. A cancel button is also
provided so that the user can easily return to the main screen. There is also a 'reports' button which will display reports
for both customers and appointments based on contacts, month and type, and country. The Contacts report allows the user
to choose a contact from the Contacts Combination Box and any associated appointments will appear in the table view.
The Country report allows the user to select a country from the Countries Combination Box and any associated customers
will be displayed in the table view. Finally, the Month and Type Report feature allows the user to view all appointments
categorized by month and by type in the table view. In addition, the program displays the total number of appointments
in the Contacts Reports screen as well as the total number of customers in the Country Reports screen.
 The exit/log out button allows the user to securely log out of and close the application.
